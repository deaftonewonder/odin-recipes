This project will be a practice all of the HTML knowledge I have acquired in the introductory lessons. 

In this project, I am going to build a basic recipe website.

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. 

The website won’t look very pretty by the time I’ve finished but it’s important to keep in mind that this project is just to build my HTML chops; we will revisit this project in the future to style it up with CSS.
